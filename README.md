## Overview

The Food Truck Ordering System allows users to choose from a predefined menu. The system prompts users to select menu categories by entering corresponding numbers.

2. ```Follow the prompts``` to select items from the menu and specify quantities.
3. The system will display the ```selected items```, prices, and quantities**.
4. Optionally, the customer can ```continue adding items or finalize the order```.
5. The system calculates the ```total cost of the order``` and displays it.
